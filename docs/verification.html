<h1>Verification</h1>

<p>An important concept of Please is that you should be getting what you expect at
  each build. Third-party dependencies are an important case for this since they allow
  code you don't totally control into your build.<br/>
  Please has two explicit mechanisms for controlling this.</p>


<h2>Hash verification</h2>

<p>Please can natively verify hashes of packages. Some of the built-in rules for fetching
  things from third-party repos have this option, and you can add it to your own genrules.
  For example, one of the Python libraries we use:

  <pre><code class="language-plz">
    pip_library(
        name = 'six',
        version = '1.9.0',
        outs = ['six.py'],
        hashes = ['sha1: 0c31ab7cf1a2761efa32d9a7e891ddeadc0d8673'],
    )
  </code></pre>

  This declares that the calculated sha1 hash of the package must match one of the given
  set, and it's a failure if not.
</p>

<p>You can find the output hash of a particular target by running
  <code>plz hash //third_party/python:six</code> which will calculate it for you, and
  you can enter it in the BUILD file.<br/>
  If it changes (for example when you update the version) plz can update the BUILD file
  for you via <code>plz hash --update //third_party/python:six</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for allowing multiple hashes is for rules that generate different outputs
  on different architectures; this is common for Python libraries which have a compiled
  component, for example.</p>

<p>For testing purposes you can run Please with the <code>--nohash_verification</code>
  flag which will reduce hash verification failures to a warning message only.</p>

<p>Note that when using this you must be careful that the outputs of your rule are
  really deterministic. This is generally true for <code>remote_file</code> calls,
  but obviously only if the server returns the same thing every time for that URL.
  Some care should be taken with <code>pip_library</code> since the outputs of a
  <code>pip install</code> for a package containing binary (not pure Python) modules are
  not bit-for-bit identical if compiled locally, only if you downloaded a precompiled wheel.
  Different Python and OS versions can affect it too.</p>

<p>The <code>sha1:</code> prefix is informative only and indeed any string can occur before
  the colon. In future we may extend this to allow specifying other hash types.</p>


<h2>Licence validation</h2>

<p>Please can attempt to autodetect licences from some third-party packages and inform you if
  they're not ones you'd accept. You mark licences in the .plzconfig file like so:
  <pre><code>
    [licences]
    accept = MIT
    accept = BSD
    reject = MS-EULA
  </code></pre>
  By default, with no <code>[licences]</code> section, Please won't perform any licence
  checking.<br/>
  Once you've added some any package with a licence must have a matching accepted licence
  in the config.</p>

<p>Currently we can autodetect licences from <code>pip_library</code> and <code>maven_jars</code> rules,
  you can also set them manually via the <code>licences</code> attribute on a rule.</p>

<p>It bears mentioning that this is done as a best-effort - since licences and their
  locations are not standardised in pip (and many other places) we can't always be fully
  confident about how to match licence names and hence don't try (for example,
  <code>Apache 2</code>, <code>Apache-2.0</code>,  and
  <code>The Apache Software License, version 2</code> all refer to the same licence,
  despite being very different strings, whereas <code>LGPL</code> and <code>AGPL</code>
  are significantly different licences but only one letter apart).</p>

<p>Please also isn't a lawyer and can't provide advice about whether a specific licence is
  suitable for you or not. Only you can make that decision.</p>
