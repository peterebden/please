<h1>Require / Provide</h1>

<p>This is a generalised mechanism for rules to provide specialised dependencies to other
  rules. The most obvious example is <code>proto_library</code>, which generates code for
  multiple languages, usually only one of which is actually needed by each dependency</p>

<p>We could break it up into multiple parts explicitly, but ideally we want to maintain
  the illusion that there's one rule by the name given in the BUILD file and have all other
  rules depend only on that. However it's pretty suboptimal to have your
  <code>python_library</code> have to wait for the C++ and Java generated code to compile.</p>

<p>This is solved by the <code>proto_library</code> rule declaring the following property:
    <pre><code class="language-plz">
    provides = {
        'py': ':python_dependency',
        'java': ':java_dependency',
        'cc': ':cc_dependency',
    }
    </code></pre>
  And then the <code>python_library</code> rule is annotated with
    <pre><code class="language-plz">
    requires = ['py'],
    </code></pre>
  Individually neither has any effect, but when a rule with a particular <code>require</code>
  depends on another with a matching <code>provide</code>, its dependency is matched directly
  to the one specified by the providing rule. This means that it can skip other dependencies
  that it doesn't care about and be matched only to the ones it does.</p>

<p>The consequence of this - skipping the actual declared dependency - can be a bit
  nonobvious so should be invoked sparingly. Typically the rule declaring
  <code>provides</code> should be a no-op collecting rule such as <code>filegroup</code>
  and the various provided rules shouldn't normally be needed together. Different languages
  are the most common example here (and indeed this feature was nearly named
  <code>language</code> at one point).</p>

<p>The <code>requires</code> stanza is also responsible for colouring the interactive build
  output. Currently the available colours are hardcoded but one of these days they might
  become configurable.</p>
