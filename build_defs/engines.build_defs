# In future we would obviously like to migrate; most likely the difference
# comes from many extra .encode() / .decode() calls since the BUILD files use
# strings but cffi requires everything to be converted to bytes :(
# PyPy is not available because it typically does not ship with static libraries,
# nor a pkg-config setup we can use to locate where it is installed.
# Again, it would be nice to investigate that more in future.
